  Notes 
  These programs incorporate new developments on spectral graph partitioning as 
  described in the following thesis: 

  Computational Models of Perceptual Organization 
  Stella X. Yu, May 2003, Carnegie Mellon University 

  except Chapter 4 where Hermitian matrices are used. 
  However, they can be extended by modifying related c functions to deal with 
  imaginary number multiplications.
